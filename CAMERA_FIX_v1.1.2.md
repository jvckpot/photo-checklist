# Camera Layout Fix - Version 1.1.2

## Issues Fixed
1. ❌ Scroll bar appearing after taking photos
2. ❌ Camera view not filling entire screen consistently
3. ❌ "Screen Lock Disabled" notification blocking interface

## Changes Made

### CSS (style.css)
**Camera Screen Layout:**
- Changed from flexbox to absolute positioning for full-screen coverage
- Camera video now fills 100vh with no scroll
- Header positioned absolutely at top (z-index: 20)
- Controls positioned absolutely at bottom (z-index: 20)
- Done button floats at bottom-right (z-index: 30)
- Thumbnail container max-height set to prevent overflow

**Wake Lock Indicator:**
- Completely hidden with `display: none !important`

### JavaScript (camera.js)
**Wake Lock Management:**
- Removed wake lock indicator visibility toggles
- Wake lock still functions (keeps screen on) but shows no UI notification
- Cleaner user experience without distracting notifications

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken):
```
#cameraScreen
├── .camera-header (flex-shrink: 0)
├── .camera-container (flex: 1)
└── .camera-controls (flex-shrink: 0)  ← This caused scroll when thumbnails added
```

### After (Fixed):
```
#cameraScreen (position: relative, height: 100vh)
├── .camera-header (position: absolute, top: 0)
├── .camera-container (position: absolute, fills screen)
└── .camera-controls (position: absolute, bottom: 0)
    └── #donePhotosBtn (position: absolute, bottom-right)
```

## Benefits
✅ No scrolling on camera screen regardless of photo count
✅ Consistent full-screen camera view on all devices

✅ Done button always accessible in bottom-right corner
✅ Thumbnails scroll horizontally without breaking layout

cd "Z:\Documents\AI Coding\photo-checklist"

git remote add origin https://github.com/bytwyg/property-inspection-app.git

git push -u origin main
```

**Password:** Use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

### Create Token:

2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "Property Inspection Deploy"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (check the box)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you can't see it again!)
7. Use this as your password when pushing

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Repository already exists"
Already created? Skip to Step 2.

### "Permission denied"
Need to set up authentication. See section above.

### "Could not resolve host"
Check internet connection.

### Can't find deploy.bat
You're already in the folder! Just run the commands in Option B.

After GitHub Pages enables (2-3 min), check:

- [ ] Can access URL in browser
- [ ] Camera permissions work on iPad
- [ ] Can take photos
- [ ] Skip button works

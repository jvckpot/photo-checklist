## 🛠️ How to Make Changes

### Want to add a new checklist item?

**File**: js/app.js  
**Location**: Look for `CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE`  
**Example**: Add to kitchen items:

```javascript
kitchen: {
    title: 'Kitchen',
    items: [
        'Walls/Paint',
        'Flooring',
        // ... existing items ...
        'Garbage Disposal',  // ← ADD YOUR NEW ITEM HERE
        'Windows/Screens/Blinds'
    ]
}
```

Save → Reload page → New item appears!

### Want to change colors?

**File**: css/style.css  
**Location**: Look for `:root` at the top

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2563eb;  /* ← Change to your color */
    --success-color: #16a34a;
    /* etc. */
}
```

### Want to change button text?

**File**: index.html  
**Location**: Search for the button text  
**Example**: Change "Start Inspection" to "Begin Inspection"

Find this:
```html
<button class="btn-primary" id="startInspection">Start Inspection →</button>
```

Change to:
```html
<button class="btn-primary" id="startInspection">Begin Inspection →</button>
```

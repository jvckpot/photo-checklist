# ✅ UPDATE COMPLETE - v1.1.0

## 🎯 What Changed

You requested the ability to **skip items** during inspection that don't apply to a particular apartment. 

**The distinction:**
- ⚙️ **Customization (Settings)** = Property-wide defaults (e.g., "no garages at this property")
- ⊘ **Skip Button** = Per-inspection decisions (e.g., "this unit doesn't have a pantry")

## ✨ New Feature: Skip Button

### What It Does:
Each checklist item now has TWO buttons:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Kitchen                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  □ Pantry                               │
│     No photos            [📷]  [⊘]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
        Photo Button ──────┘      │
        Skip Button ──────────────┘
```

### How It Works:

1. **Click 📷** = Open camera to take photos
2. **Click ⊘** = Mark as N/A (doesn't apply to this unit)
3. **Both count as "complete"** for progress tracking

### Visual Feedback:

**With Photos:**
```
✓ Pantry
  ✓ 3 photo(s)                [✓]  [⊘]
  (Green background)
```

**Skipped:**
```
⊘ Pantry  
  ⊘ Skipped (N/A)             [📷]  [↶]
  (Gray background)
```

**Not Done:**
```
□ Pantry
  No photos                   [📷]  [⊘]
  (White background)
```

### Click Skip Again to Undo:
- Skip button changes to **↶** (undo icon)
- Click again to un-skip the item
- If item has photos, you'll get a confirmation

---

## 📊 Updated Progress Tracking

**Before:**
- Only photographed items counted as complete
- User forced to take photos of N/A items

**After:**
- Photographed items = complete ✓
- Skipped items = complete ✓
- Only unphotographed, non-skipped items = incomplete

**Example Progress:**
```
12 of 15 items complete
  - 9 items with photos
  - 3 items skipped
  - 3 items still need attention
```

## 🎮 Try It Out

### Test Scenario:

1. **Start a new inspection**
2. **For an item like "Garage":**
   - If unit has a garage → Click 📷, take photos
   - If unit has no garage → Click ⊘, mark as skipped
3. **Check progress** → Skipped items count as complete
4. **Review screen** → See skipped items listed (no photos)
5. **Export ZIP** → Only contains photos (skipped items not included)

---

## 🤔 Why This Matters

### Real-World Use Case:

**Scenario:** You're inspecting Unit 205
- Building has garages, but Unit 205 doesn't
- You previously had to either:
  - Take a photo of empty space ❌
  - Leave it incomplete ❌
  - Remove "Garage" from settings for whole property ❌

**Now:**
- Just click ⊘ Skip on "Garage" ✅
- Progress shows complete ✅
- Review shows it was skipped (not forgotten) ✅
- No fake photos in ZIP file ✅

---

## 📖 Updated Documentation

### User Workflow:

```
For each checklist item, ask yourself:

1. "Does this apply to this unit?"
   └─ NO  → Click ⊘ Skip
   └─ YES → Continue to step 2

2. "Can I take photos of it?"
   └─ YES → Click 📷 Take Photos
   └─ NO  → Document why (separate process)
```
